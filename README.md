## Introduction
This repository contains the three python scripts requested for exercises 1, 4 and 5. Their respective names are ```rgb_yuv.py```, ```run_length_encoding.py``` and ```dct.py```. A part from these, there are also two folders, _Images_ and _Scripts_, containing the resulting images from exercises 2 and 3 and the screenshots from the terminal showing the command lines used. Each of these exercises are explained below, with some comments explaning the results.

### Exercise 2
In this exercise we compare the same video, with resolution 480p, for both VP9 and h265 codecs.

We oberve both videos side to side and see that, at first sight, there is not a clear difference regarding resolution between them, since both are quite high. 

However, h265 slightly outperforms VP9. This observation is more clear at the edges of the figures, where h265 displays the shapes with smoother edges than VP9.
