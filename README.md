## Introduction
This repository contains three python scripts named ```conversion.py```, ```comparison.py``` and ```live_streaming.py``` containing the requested methods for this lab. In the upload of the Aula Global you can find a folder named _Output files_ which contains the input video BBB.mp4 and all its versions resulting from the different operations applied in the methods. It is uploaded there since its size is bigger than the requested to upload it in Github.

### Exercise 2
In this exercise we compare the same video, with resolution 480p, for both VP9 and h265 codecs. We oberve both videos side to side and see that, at first sight, there is not a clear difference regarding resolution between them, since both are quite high. However, h265 slightly outperforms VP9. This observation is more clear at the edges of the figures, where h265 displays the shapes with smoother edges than VP9.
